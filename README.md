# About this project

This project is a really simple web app that allows the user to send [TaleSpire](https://talespire.com/) custom Dice rolls. The app uses [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) for the React.js development server.

This is by no means the right way to do this but it was quick and required little extra work or research from me.

# Running the Dev Server

In order to run the development server that displays this project, run
```
npm start
```
